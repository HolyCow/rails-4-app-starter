Rails 4 App Starter
===================

When I create an app using https://github.com/HolyCow/rails-4-starter, I use this as a starting point for the new vagrant box.  I will either fork or copy these files and then put the app folder (rails new <my_app> folder would be called 'my_app) in the root of this repository.

How
===

* Clone this repository
* Delete .git
* Copy in your app
* Run 'librarian-chef install'
* Run 'vagrant up' and 'vagrant provision'
